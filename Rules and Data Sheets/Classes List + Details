There are 4 main classes:

Warrior – Uses strength as his/her main stat. Powerful, Heavy, and tough to take down one on one.
Uses heavy melee weapons. However, gets easily taken down by any sort of ranged attack.

Rogue – The fastest out of all the main classes. Uses Agility as his/her main stat.
Able to get to places no one else can, and attacks very quickly with high priority (at the cost of damage).
Can also wield ranged physical weapons. However, gets taken down incredibly easily by anyone who can armor through attacks.

Mage – Only class that can use spellbooks. Uses Knowledge as his/her main stat. Can use either short ranged or long ranged magic,
but must have a spellbook to use it. Spells also require a charge time, so Mages get taken down fairly easily by fast, rushdown type enemies.

Priest – Priests use something in between magic and a physical weapon that lets them heal teammates.
Uses Knowledge, WK as his/her main stat. Little to no offensive capabilities. However, can also give powerful buffs and debuff enemies.

Each of these classes also have subclasses that you can branch out into that are much more specialized.
